#Sportive / Road Bikes

Sportive bikes are most commonly referred to as *road bikes*, but the term road bicycle can also describe any type of bike used primarily on paved roads, in contrast to bikes primarily intended for off-road use, such as mountain bikes.

Compared to other styles of bicycle, road bicycles share common features:
The tires are narrow, high-pressure, and smooth to decrease rolling resistance.
They usually use derailleur gears; however, single-speed and fixed-gear varieties exist.
The bicycle is of a lightweight construction.
