#Style Report

Keep in mind that the personas are an ESL single father and a yuppie design student


##Concept 1

###Pros

This design is fun and uplifting. A friendly look might compliment the nature of the site very well, and not intimidate a novice user.

###Cons

The colour palette is probably too saturated to spend a lot of time on the site. 


##Concept 2

###Pros

The design is modern and calm, navigation items are clear, and the flyout doesn't take up much space.

###Cons

This seems over-stylized, as it seems pretty exclusive to younger, trendy users. It will probably not appeal to older folks, like the single father. I also don't think a serious tone matches the essence of the site well.

##Concept 3

###Pros

The colour palette is comfortable for reading, and design seems condusive to both personas. Flat design allows the content to stand out.

###Cons

Navigation flyout takes up too much space, and typography could use work. Don't think the antiquarian feel works for bikesâ€”the website should not be scholarly.

##Final thoughts

Seeing that the site is to be a fun and welcoming place for a wide range of people, I feel that the design that best embodies the essence of the site is concept 1. However, elements from the other concepts should be used as inspiration for colours / layout. I definitely would like to experiment with more muted colours and a flatter design. Users should find the site easy to navigate while still having personality.
