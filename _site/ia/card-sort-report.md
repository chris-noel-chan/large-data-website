## Observations

- I was unaware that I was to make observations and inqueries to my participants' decisions, and unfortunately did not manage to collect data on their experience of sorting. Seeing as this was my first card sort, this error will not be repeated.
- Both participants made similar common groupings; the only notabile difference being a subdivision of *mechanics* and *safety* in sort 1 that were not present in sort 2
- The names of cards should be more discriminating. Participant 1 seemed to have difficulty deciding whether cards should be filed under *safety* or *mechanics* (although arguably, they are interrelated)
- Both sorts were for the most part in accordance to my pre-concieved expectations. Discrepancies were minor, but insightful.
- I was surprised that *choosing the right bike for you*—which I had intended to be a category on it's own—was filed under the subcategory of *safety*. However, I can follow the participant's logic.
- I like participant 2's idea of making *bike culture/movements* a subcategory on its own. Within the context of this card being a subcategory, I believe it should be renamed *Biking: why we do it*
